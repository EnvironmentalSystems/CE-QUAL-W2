# CE-QUAL-W2

CE‐QUAL‐W2 (W2) is a two‐dimensional (2D), longitudinal/vertical, hydrodynamics and water quality model. Because the model assumes lateral homogeneity, it is especially suited for relatively long and narrow waterbodies exhibiting longitudinal and vertical water quality gradients. The model has been applied to rivers, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries and combinations thereof.

## Version 4.5 Capabilities and Limitations

W2 includes variable density as affected by temperature, salinity, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) to simulate stratified flow. There are 28 water quality constituent state variables, and any combination of constituents can be included or excluded from a simulation. The effects of salinity or total dissolved solids/salinity on density, and thus hydrodynamics, are included only when simulated in the water quality module. The water quality algorithm is modular, allowing constituents to be easily added as additional subroutines. 

Many new features and enhancements can be utilized in the current model release, Version 4.5, including executables, source codes, and examples for the model and preprocessor. A stand-alone V4 GUI preprocessor is included as part of the download package. A post-processor for W2 model output has been used since the V3.7 model by the DSI, Inc. group, and an Excel macro utility aids the model user in writing out files compatible with CE-QUAL-W2.

### Model Capabilities

The CE-QUAL-W2 model incorporates the following water quality considerations: Longitudinal-vertical hydrodynamics and water quality in stratified and non-stratified systems, nutrients-dissolved oxygen-organic matter interactions, fish habitat, selective withdrawal from stratified reservoir outlets, hypolimnetic aeration, multiple algae, epiphyton/periphyton, zooplankton, macrophyte, CBOD, sediment diagenesis model, and generic water quality groups, internal dynamic pipe/culvert model, and hydraulic structures (weirs, spillways) algorithms. The hydraulic structures algorithms include submerged and two-way flow over submerged hydraulic structures as well as a dynamic shading algorithm based on topographic and vegetative cover.

### Model Limitations
CE-QUAL-W2 Version 4.5 functions under the following general assumptions: Flows are assumed to be well mixed in lateral direction (can be used in a Quasi-3-D mode via additional model branches), and hydrostasis is assumed for the vertical momentum equation.
